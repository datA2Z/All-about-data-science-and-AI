It has high response rate and having good confidentiality with trusted and personal service. Due to that unwanted SMS known as spam SMS will arise which will generate different problem to mobile user. To identify such spam message is one of the important challenges in internet and wireless network. We are using Naive Bayes classifiers, a family of classifiers that are based on the popular Bayesâ€™ probability theorem, are known for creating simple yet well performing models.

	- [Natural language processing Part one](https://github.com/datA2Z/All-about-data-science-and-AI/blob/master/Natural%20language%20processing/Natural%20language%20processing%20Part%20one.ipynb): The objectives of this Analysis is to understand the different text review provided by customers using Python. The first part of the notebook provides a basic understanding review using NLP techniques like Sentiment analysis, wordcloud.
